#### Komposerizer plugin for Flow Launcher

This is supposed to be a plugin that crudely implements the [Composerize](https://github.com/composerize/composerize "Link to Composerize GitHub repo.") functionality, i.e.:

1. Open Flow Launcher
2. Paste a `docker run ...` command
3. Something happens
4. You get the command converted for use in a `docker-compose.yml` file

Will this work? No. Do I know what I'm doing? No. Is the erroneous "K" in *Komposerizer* on purpose? Yes.
